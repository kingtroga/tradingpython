## Conclusion

The Moving Average Crossover strategy demonstrated moderate effectiveness with a 40% success rate across the tested technology stocks. The strategy performed best in trending, lower-volatility environments (AMZN, AAPL) and struggled in choppy, high-volatility conditions (GOOGL, MSFT).

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Market selectivity is crucial** - the strategy works well in trending markets but fails in sideways conditions
2. **Risk management is effective** - 1% stop-loss prevented catastrophic losses
3. **Stock selection matters** - lower volatility stocks showed better risk-adjusted returns
4. **False signals are the main weakness** - requiring additional confirmation could improve performance

The strategy generated a net profit of $266.65 across all positions with manageable risk levels, suggesting it has merit as part of a diversified systematic trading approach, particularly when enhanced with additional filters and risk management techniques.

**Overall Assessment:** Moderately successful with clear areas for improvement. The strategy foundation is sound but requires refinement for consistent profitability across diverse market conditions.
